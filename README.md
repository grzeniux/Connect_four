# Connect_four

The project presents a connect four game. It was a project done for a subject in college, for a course pass.
The game involves two players, labelled blue and purple, who take turns placing their symbols in
vertical columns of a grid with dimensions set by the user.
The aim of the game is to line up the four symbols of your colour, horizontally, vertically or diagonally, before
your opponent does. The game develops strategic skills and requires the ability to anticipate your opponent's
moves.
